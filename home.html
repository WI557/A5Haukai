        We specializes in Māori kai and is based in the Bay of Islands. It was started by a 
        couple who wanted to create a business that would appeal to locals and tourists visiting the area.
        The dinner menu features Māori and Pākeha kai options and drinks. 
        We want customers to experience Te Ao Māori with the use of karakia for blessing food
        and other Māori culture elements in their new web application.
